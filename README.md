# PubTator collections on COVID-19

[Pubtator](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/) provides automated annotations of biomedical entities in scientific publications, including the [LitCovid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/) and [CORD-19](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research) collections on COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2. Annotations are provided for six entity types (gene/protein, drug/chemical, disease, cell type, species and genomic variants) in three formats (BioC JSON, BioC XML and PubTator). 

## LitCovid
[LitCovid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/) is a curated literature hub for tracking up-to-date scientific information about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 [1]. It is the most comprehensive resource on the subject, with new PubMed and PubMed Central articles added daily. PubTator annotations for LitCovid are updated once per day. Articles in the Open Access subset include the full article text; some very recent articles will only include a title and will be updated when the abstract is made available.<br/><br/>
Download PubTator annotations for LitCovid from the NCBI LitCovid FTP site: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/LitCovid/

## CORD-19
[CORD-19](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research), the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset includes approximately 59,000 scholarly articles, provided by the [Allen Institute](https://alleninstitute.org/) [2]. PubTator annotations for CORD-19 are updated weekly.<br/><br/>
Download the PubTator annotations for CORD-19 at the NCBI CORD-19 FTP site: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/CORD19/.

## PubTator
PubTator (description: entity types and tools used, links to web pages). the full article text (if available) BioC format JSON, BioC XML and PubTator formats. The BioC formats are described at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/bionlp/APIs/BioC-PMC/, and include the full article text, if available. The PubTator format includes title and abstract, and is described at XXX.
