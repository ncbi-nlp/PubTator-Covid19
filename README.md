# PubTator collections on COVID-19

[Pubtator](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/) provides automated annotations of several biomedical entities in scientific publications, including two collections related to COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2: [LitCovid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/) and [CORD-19](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research). Six entity types are annotated: gene/protein, drug/chemical, disease, cell type, species and genomic variants. Annotations are provided in three formats (BioC JSON, BioC XML and PubTator) and include the full article text, if available (see details below). 

## LitCovid
[LitCovid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/) is a curated literature hub for tracking up-to-date scientific information about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. It is the most comprehensive resource on the subject, with new PubMed and PubMed Central articles added daily. PubTator annotations for LitCovid are updated once per day, and can be downloaded from the NCBI LitCovid FTP site at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/LitCovid/. Some very recent articles only include a title, the abstract will be added when made available.

## CORD-19
[CORD-19](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research), the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset includes approximately 59,000 scholarly articles, provided by the [Allen Institute](https://alleninstitute.org/). PubTator annotations for CORD-19 are updated weekly, and can be downloaded from the NCBI CORD-19 FTP site at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/CORD19/.

## PubTator
PubTator (description: entity types and tools used, links to web pages). the full article text (if available) BioC format JSON, BioC XML and PubTator formats. The BioC formats are described at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/bionlp/APIs/BioC-PMC/, and include the full article text, if available. The PubTator format is described at XXX, and only includes the title and abstract.
